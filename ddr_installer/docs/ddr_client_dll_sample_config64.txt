# --- DDR sample config file ---

# Lines should not be more than 350 characters long, file names not more than 256
# characters.

# Comments must be written with a leading '#'
# No extra spaces are allowed in config lines
# Different fields are separated by exactly one blank

All number/address values are expected to be hexadecimal values without any 
leading character.

# -- NOP out instructions -- 
# N <START ADDR> <END ADDR>
# <START ADDR> = Start program counter address for NOP'ing instructions (hex)
# <END ADDR>   = End program counter address for NOP'ing instructions (hex)
# <START ADDR> and <END ADDR> can be the same for NOP'ing one instr.
# e.g. N 004012EE 004012F6

# -- Patch EFLAG --
# T <EFLAG> <PC-ADDR>
# <EFLAG> = [CF, PF, AF, ZF, SF, DF, OF] 
# <PC-ADDR> = program counter address where to toggle the EFLAG before 
#             instruction gets executed e.g. jle (hex)
# e.g. T SF 004012C4 #example comment

# -- Always skip function at <FUNC ADDR> when called --
# <FUNC ADDR> = Functions address which gets wrapped, call to func is skipped

# --- use a start address ---
# DDR will start the instrumentation/analysis at this address
# it is useful to use this if the start/end alone doesn't do the trick
# e.g. the sample later jump to an address wich is smaller than the start address
# you handed over in the trace(L) line for example
S 140001241

# --- use a break address ---
# DDR stops instrumentation and execution of the process at this address
